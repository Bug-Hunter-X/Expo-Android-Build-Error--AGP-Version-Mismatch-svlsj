The solution involves checking your `android/build.gradle` and `android/app/build.gradle` files to find the AGP version declaration.  Compare it with the AGP version recommended in the Expo documentation for your specific Expo version. You might need to update your AGP version within these files.  Also, ensure that the AGP version is compatible with the other Gradle plugins and dependencies in your project.  If you're using a very old Expo version, you might need to consider upgrading. If you find incompatible dependencies, it might need to change or resolve dependency conflicts. This often needs careful consideration of potential ripple effects of dependency upgrades.
