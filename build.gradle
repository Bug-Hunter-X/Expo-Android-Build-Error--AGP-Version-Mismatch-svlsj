This error occurs when using the Expo CLI to build an Android app and involves a mismatch between the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) version specified in your project and the version required by Expo. The error message might not be very specific, but it usually points towards a Gradle sync failure or a problem with the build process itself.  It's often related to dependencies or configurations within the `android/build.gradle` and `android/app/build.gradle` files.
