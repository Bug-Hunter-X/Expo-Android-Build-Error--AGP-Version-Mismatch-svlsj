# Expo Android Build Error: AGP Version Mismatch

This repository demonstrates a common error encountered when building Android apps with the Expo CLI. The issue arises from an incompatibility between the Android Gradle Plugin (AGP) version used in the project and the version expected by Expo.

## Problem

The build process fails, often without a clear error message indicating the specific AGP version conflict.  The error messages from Gradle can be cryptic and difficult to interpret.

## Solution

The primary solution is to ensure your project's AGP version is compatible with the current Expo version.  This can involve updating the AGP version in your `build.gradle` files, updating Expo itself, or manually resolving conflicting dependencies.

## Reproduction Steps

1. Clone this repository.
2. Attempt to build the Android project using `expo build:android`.
3. Observe the error during the build process.
4. Apply the solution from the `bugSolution.js` file.
5. Attempt to build again to confirm successful compilation.
